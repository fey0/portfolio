# [Project 1](https://github.com/fey0/Netflix-Recommender)
* A netflix recommendation system 
* Was created using a netflix dataset from a kaggle repository
* I made this to learn how the TFIDF (Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency) technique worked 
* the TFIDF is used for giving each words in a document or description a weight which can be used 
* to facilitate search for relevant items or in this case content
