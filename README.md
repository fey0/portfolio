# [Netflix Recommendation System](https://github.com/fey0/Netflix-Recommender)

### Project Overview
Developed a recommendation system using a Netflix dataset from Kaggle to explore the TFIDF (Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency) technique. The system suggests content similar to the user's watched list based on TFIDF analysis.

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- **TFIDF Implementation:** Applied TFIDF to weight words in documents, enhancing content search and recommendations.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Created a system to recommend similar content based on user viewing history.

### Technologies Used
- **Libraries and Tools:**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` for TFIDF implementation
  - `nltk` for stopwords removal
- **Dataset:** CSV file with Netflix titles
