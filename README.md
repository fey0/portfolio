# project 1 (https://github.com/fey0/Netflix-Recommender)
* A netflix recommendation system 
* Was created using a netflix dataset from a kaggle repository
* I made this to learn how the TFIDF (Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency) technique worked 
* the TFIDF is used often in creating weights for each document or item in a repository, so it can be searched engines
