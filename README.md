# Feysele Portfolio

# [Main Project](https://github.com/fey0/Netflix-Recommender)
* A netflix recommendation system 
* Was created using a netflix dataset from a kaggle repository
* I made this to learn how the TFIDF (Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency) technique worked 
* TFIDF is often used for indexing documents for a retrieval system 
* the TFIDF is used for giving each words in a document or description a weight which can be used to facilitate search for relevant items or in this case content
* I added up on this by using it in a reccomendation system that provides users recommendations that are similar to their watched list
